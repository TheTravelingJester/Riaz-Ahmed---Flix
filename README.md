### Notes
The hardest part of this assignment for me was resizing the posters so it fit into the superhero viewcontroller. I was careless and did not change estimated size to none and I spent a lot of hours trying to figure out why my posters arent showing. I even re-did my code multiple times before I finally found what the issue was.

I didn't have too many difficulties with this. I missspelled "AlamofireImage" as "AlamoFireImage" and that took me a minute to fix.
